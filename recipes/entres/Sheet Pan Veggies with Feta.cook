Heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the lower third. On a #sheet pan{}, combine the @broccolini{1%bunch}, @grape tomatoes{2%cups}, @onion{1} and @lemon slices{1/2} with the @olive oil{3%tablespoons} and toss. Add @cumin{1%teaspoon} and @red-pepper flakes{1/2%teaspoon}, season with @salt and @pepper, and toss again until evenly coated. Nestle the @feta slices{8%ounces}. Cut into 1 inch slices into the vegetables. (Itâ€™s OK if they break apart a little.)
Roast ~{15-20%minutes}, stirring halfway through but leaving the feta in place, until the broccolini is charred at the tips, the stems are easily pierced with a fork and the tomato skins start to blister and break down.
Serve over cooked @orzo or farro{}. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with the remaining @lemon half{} for squeezing. Top with @basil or cilantro{1/2 cup roughly chopped}, if using.
